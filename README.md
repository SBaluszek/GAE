## Glioma associated epilepsy research
### Data download and preparation
Data source was TCGA (LGG and GBM projects) and GEO (GSE55918) - this process can be found in RNAseq_data.rmd
### RNAseq data analysis
Can be divided into steps:
 - RNAseq analysis (Fig1, RNAseq.rmd)
 - Gene set enrichment analysis (Fig2, GSEA.rmd) with pharmacogenomic aspects
 - Transcription factor analysis (Fig4, TFs.rmd)
### scRNAseq analysis
Data preprocessing pipeline can be found in scRNA repository.  
Datasets come from GEO database (GSE70630, GSE89567, and GSE138794)   
Integration, clustering and signature determination ensues (Fig3, scRNA.rmd)
